# Beats by Dylst - an E-Commerce App

[Live Demo](https://ecommerce-shop-roan.vercel.app/) :point_left:

## Description

After reading about the many features that Next JS provided over using simply React, I just had to try it out in a project. I thought that building an E-Commerce application would be a great way to practice utilizing Next JS.

This project helped me learn:
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js Best Practices such as file-based routing and data using server-side rendering and static site generation
- Integrate Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
- Implement Sanity to manage the entire content of the application

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
